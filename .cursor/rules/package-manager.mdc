# Managing dependencies and running scripts

The project uses `bun` as a package manager. Here are how we manage the dependencies:

* `bun add <package>` - add a new package
* `bun remove <package>` - remove an installed package
* `bun update <package>` - update a installed package
* `bun add -D <package>` - install package as development dependency
* `bun run <script>` - run a script from `package.json`
* `bunx --bun <package>` - directly run a package fom `npm`

Always use `bun`. Do not use `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm` or other package managers.
